# Xtext Tycho Example

This is a demo project showing how to build an Xtext project with tycho / maven. It features:

* Project is based on Xtext and Xtend 2.7.3
* Running the xtext generator mwe2 workflow from maven with help of the fornax mwe2 plugin
* Generated files are not checked in, everything gets generated during the build and is ignored by git
* maven clean removes all previously generated artifacts
* Running the xtend2 compiler from maven
* Creating an executable eclipse product containing the Xtext editor (without the JDT)
* Setting up continuous integration build with travis (http://travis-ci.org), Build Status: ![Build Status](https://api.travis-ci.org/ckulla/xtext-tycho-example.png?branch=master)
* Specify the file encoding on the command line
* Using an xtext grammar with special characters, i.e. setting the encoding for the xtext grammar
